title: Course Notes
description: Course notes for some of my courses.
---

This page exists so I can more easily access my collection of notes from some
of the courses I have taken or audited. Feel free to take a look but be warned,
for the most part they are not pretty or organized well. Most of them are scans
of my original handwritten notes since most of the time I learn better
taking notes for courses by hand as opposed to typing them out on a
computer.

For some of the notes, I have TeXed them up as a way to both review the
material and make it more legible and organized. I may at some point decide to
TeX more of them up, but when I do not know.

I also have a more complete description of all my relevent
[coursework](/about/coursework.pdf) which includes courses not listed below.

If you notice any errors or typos in the TeX, please let me know so I can fix
them.
