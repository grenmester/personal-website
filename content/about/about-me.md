title: About Me
description: This page is about me.

I'm currently a senior studying computer science and mathematics at Harvey Mudd
College. This semester I am a visiting student at the Hong Kong University of
Science and Technology.

Some of my interests include neural networks, machine learning, category
theory, abstract algebra, and organic chemistry. I also enjoy working on
puzzles, learning about new things, tutoring, playing badminton, and going
bowling in my spare time. I am able to speak (or pretend to speak) English,
Cantonese, Mandarin, Spanish, and Japanese, of which I have listed by
decreasing proficiency.

Feel free to check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/grenmester) and some of
the [projects](/about/projects) that I have been working on. You may also be
interested in looking at my [resume](/about/resume.pdf), [CV](/about/cv.pdf),
or a list of my [coursework](/about/coursework.pdf). I also have a collection
of highly unpolished [notes](/about/course-notes) from some of my courses.

I occasionally attend competitions, puzzle hunts, hackathons, and other fun
activities. The following is a list of some those events that I remember
attending, along with when I attended and maybe some other information.
