This website was created for me to post about random things. It is still very
much a work in progress. You can find a list of the posts I have written
[here](/post/).

This website was created using the static site generator
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the pages were written in
[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started), a lightweight markup
language. The beautiful mathematical equations you see on this site were
rendered using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/), a JavaScript display engine
for [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/). The site is deployed on
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), a platform offering hosting and
serverless backend services for static websites.
