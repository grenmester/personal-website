Welcome to my personal website!

I'm currently a senior studying computer science and mathematics at Harvey Mudd
College. This semester I am a visiting student at the Hong Kong University of
Science and Technology.

This website was created for me to post about random things. It is still very
much a work in progress. To learn more about this site, visit the [about](/about)
page.
