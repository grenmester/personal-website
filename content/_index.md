Welcome to my personal website! My name is Jacky and I recently graduated from
Harvey Mudd College with a degree in computer science and mathematics. If you
would like to learn more about me, visit the [about me](/about/about-me) page.

This website was created for me to post about random things. It is still very
much a work in progress. You can find a list of the posts I have written
[here](/post/).

If you notice any errors or typos on this website, please let me know so I can
fix them.
